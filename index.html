		  <p>The CSON Simulation Center is located on the 5th floor of the Covenant Children’s Hospital and is available to all students for their learning needs. The Simulation Center has 4 large mid fidelity patient rooms for skills acquisition, 3 high fidelity patient rooms, and 3 debriefing rooms. Each of the patient rooms has been designed to accurately simulate the hospital environment. Each high-fidelity room has the capability for audio and video recording. Each debriefing room is equipped for remote viewing and video replay of high-fidelity simulations on 42-inch video monitors. Instructors may choose to utilize audiovisual recordings of the simulation for use by the instructor during the debriefing period to enhance student learning. Simulation Center activities can be designed for interdisciplinary activities, for example, nursing and Covenant School of Radiography students participate in patient transfer and body mechanics labs together.</p>
